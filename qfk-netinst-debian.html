So I've had my own Debian server for several years now, but after adding random services and things getting bunged up, I decided to dip my toes into server virtualisation/containerization world by switching to Proxmox to isolate my services and leave my host as bare bones as possible. After getting Proxmox installed on a minimal Debian install I have network connections, can install packages, modify the system, etc from the Proxmox GUI console. However, for the life of me I can't seem to figure. Buy a set of CDs or DVDs from one of the vendors selling Debian CDs. Many of the vendors sell the distribution for less than US plus shipping (check their web page to see if they ship internationally). What's the preferred way to get my Intel 1000 wifi controller up and running with my WPA network? I have installed the netinst Debian 9 Alpha 4 installation but I am running into problems edit: until now I got the iwlwifi driver installed but now am stuck. 
Debian (/ ˈ d ɛ b i ə n /) is a Unix-like operating system consisting entirely of free software. Ian Murdock founded the Debian Project on August 16, 1993. Debian 0.01 was released on September 15, 1993, and the first stable version, 1.1, was released Hi, I'm attempting to install debian on an old computer that I had from 2009 - GT5628. The computer had recently had its RAM die, so I swapped in some new RAM for it and now it has 4 GB. I've tried installing with the following isos: debian-8.0.0-amd64-CD debian-8.0.0-amd64-netinst debian-8.0.0-arm64-CD debian-8.0.0-i385-CD The reason that I've been trying so many is because I expected the normal amd64 installer to work, but after hitting "Install," "Graphical Install," and "Automated. The following article provides some useful tips on how to find all files within any specific directory or entire file-system containing any specific word or string. The first command example will search for a string stretch in all files within /etc/ directory while excluding any sub-directories. Hi, I've set up a little server, netinst debian, added ssh and mysql. I created a little script that tweets my dynamic IP upon change. Some fellas found the twitter account with the IP (I guess, maybe they did some scanning.) I've got some IP's and usernames they tried to log in with. Can you give me a hint? How can I play with them a little bit? I've got the list in a text file, but I'm not sure if I can post it here. Open Debian Download page and download the right cd / dvd for your pc. Most likely, if you have a modern computer, you'll want amd64 version. I'd suggest to choose cd because today you'll probably have a broadband connection and you'll be able to download other needed packages later very quickly. I'm trying to install Debian on a X541U Asus laptop, but every time I try to, it just freezes or crashes in a random place (last couple of tries have been in the same spot). I'm linking a video where you can see what I'm talking about. After downloading and installing all the files the screen starts blinking and it says it doesn't have space. For background, I had Windows 10 installed on this PC. I am not trying to dual boot, I actually already (through Debian installer) partitioned and formatte.

Is capable the netinstall iso to download all needed package trough wifi (wpa2) network?.it will already include package for wpa2 autentication with some sort of gui? Thanks. Fresh installs of LinuxCNC are most easily created using the Live/Install Image. This is a hybrid ISO filesystem image that can be written to a USB storage device or a DVD and used to boot a computer. 
Hi. Would it be the 64-bit DVD? What would be the 2nd most downloaded? And third? I want to seed just the most popular ones.

I downloaded and installed the latest debian minimal netinst image on a 4gb usb flash drive. Install process went flawlessly, without network, only the basic minimal install. Problem is, I can't boot from it. I disabled quick boot, secure boot, set legacy mode on BIOS, boot from USB key first. I partitioned and mounted a single "/" mount point on the flash drive with ext4, installed grub on the correct device (/dev/sdc in my case). I intend to use this as a portable hdd, really handy.

Hello, like the title said i can't seem to update ( due to following error: amp#x200B; W: GPG error: disco InRelease: The following signatures couldn't be verified because the public key is not available: NO_PUBKEY 4F4EA0AAE5267A6C W: The repository ' disco InRelease' is not signed.

Hello there, would like to get some assist or pointers to solving my problem. In short: I've got an SSD and thought I'd remove my old hard drive and install a new distro. Wrote buster-netinst directly to a USB key with standard dd. ampnbsp; Rebooted. Installer booted up just fine, selected 'Install' and got until selecting locale when I realized I forgot to set my BIOS to UEFI. Rebooted again, set BIOS to UEFI. Installer loads and after selecting 'Install', now I get a whole bunch of graph. Hey everyone! Using a USB thumb drive (that worked perfectly for ALL the Debian 9 RC installers) to install the netinst version (AMD64) and can't get past the first few screens. Stuck at: "Your installation CD-ROM couldn't be mounted". 
I tried to install Debian with the frimware-9.1.0-amd64-nestinst.iso. After selecting keyboard and local, the installer says that no wifi card was detected and that there I need to plug a seperate USB stick in to load firmware. The page I got the ISO from (https://cdimage.debian.org/cdimage/unofficial/non-free/cd-including-firmware/current/amd64/iso-cd/) claims that it should include the nonfree firmware. What should. I love virtualization, so wanna check out more headless host options as so far my host has just been sitting on Debian at a full 1500 package install, a bit much for just virtualization huh? any suggestions. I come from a background of regular Ubuntu user, both of desktop and the server variants. I also have some minute experience with Red Hat and CentOS. I do not understand the point of the mind-boggingly vast selection of installers and live media. Why the heck is network installation limited to to `netinst` images? Why can't I perform that on regular installers or live ISOs? They're already big, why can't you just enable the network installation features on them? But that's still acceptable Hi, I've done the netinst of Debian jessie because I wish to use i3 as my WM only and don't want all the bloat of Gnome to have to try and uninstall. Anyway, Firefox does not seem to be in the repos? Am I forced to either run Iceweisel or install the Firefox DEB manually every update? Thanks. I installed Debian last night using the netinstall cd and booted into it and it looked great, much faster boot than fedora too. One thing I was disapointed with is that installing the gnome desktop package installs a whole pile of stuff I don't want and it seems harder to remove than Buntu/Mint/Fedora. I was really hoping that the netinstall with just gnome and your system tools would be a minimum install limited packages and then I could move on from there and install what programs so i installed debian but in the install only 'standard system utils' was theyre and i couldnt install enything else how do i install the print server debian desktop environment and gnome/ when i do apt-get install gnome e; unable to locate package gnome  
I'm a newbie, bare with me. Downloaded Debian 9.4 and I'm going to install it via USB. I'm using Universal USB Installer and there's two alternatives for Debian, Live and Netinst. Which should I choose and why? Whats the difference. Just installed Debian Jessie, was removing some services that were listening on ports that were not needed. My iptables looks like this (see below), I checked port 1900 online and it's used for a mediatomb upnp media server, this is not in my /etc/init.d directory, there is a rygel application that shares media through DLNA but that is disabled. I disabled this service easily on another pc I installed jessie on, but can't remember the link - it's not started in init.d Hi. I'm trying to install Debian, but I can't boot from the CD: my computer sounds like its reading it for a while and then it goes to the Grub as if there was no CD. I've been able to boot from CD other times, so I'm sure the BIOS is configured to do so, but it doesn't seems to work with this one. Is there any way to check if the CD was well-burnt? Do you think of any other things I could look try? thank Network install from a minimal CD. A network install or netinst CD is a single CD which enables you to install the entire operating system.
